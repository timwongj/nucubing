#NU Cubing

This Node.js application was created for the weekly contest held at the Northeastern Cubing Club meetings.
It uses the passport facebook strategy for authentication and express sessions client sessions.
The app provides users the ability to either submit their times manually or use a timer for each event.
The scrambles for each of these events are generated by the official WCA TNoodle scrambling application and every user receives the same scrambles.
These results are stored in a MongoDB database and can be seen on the profile, contest, and results pages.
The details of these results as well as everyone else's results can be seen on the results page.
