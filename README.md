#NU Cubing

This Node.js application was created for the weekly contest held at the Northeastern Cubing Club meetings.
It uses the Passport Facebook strategy for authentication and client sessions.
The app provides users the ability to submit their times for each event (Rubik's Cube, 4x4 Cube, 5x5 Cube, 2x2 Cube, 3x3 Blindfolded, 3x3 One-Handed, and Pyraminx).
The scrambles for each of these events are generated by the official WCA TNoodle scrambling application and every user receives the same scrambles.
These results are stored in a MongoDB database and can be seen on the profile and contest pages.
The details of these results as well as everyone else's results can be seen on the results page.
An additional feature to be added in the future is a built in timer in the app for users to complete their solves.
