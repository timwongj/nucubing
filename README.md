#NU Cubing

This Node.js application was created for the weekly contest held at the Northeastern Cubing Club meetings.
It uses the Passport Facebook strategy for authentication and client sessions.
The app provides users the ability to submit their times for each event.
The scrambles for each of these events are generated by the official WCA TNoodle scrambling application and every user receives the same scrambles.
These results are stored in a MongoDB database and can be seen on the profile and contest pages.
The details of these results as well as everyone else's results can be seen on the results page.
